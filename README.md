# TextReplacer
A simple console tool in C# with the .NET framework for replacing a certain phrase across all the files in a folder on your computer.

The code is mostly AI, I had to make a few changes to get rid of hallucinations and such. 

Also this is my first time posting to github, I hope I'm doing it right :)

Also quick tutorial: if you want to run the program go to bin/Debug and download the **TextReplacer.exe** file, if you want to see the code open **Program.cs**
